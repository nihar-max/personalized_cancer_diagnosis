## Task: Classify the given genetic variations/mutations based on evidence from text-based clinical literature

### In detail explaination:
1. Lets take a example where a person seems to have a symptoms of cancer and he visits a hospital where they basicaly remove the Cancer Tumor from person & then sequence those cancer tumor (genetic sequencing)
2. So after doing genetic sequencing of cancer tumor we get gene, gene mutation/variations where a small variation in a gene can cause cancer by destroying entire genetic core system 
Note: All types of Mutation does not cause cancer only few of them cause
So this is what we are going to do with help of features (gene , gene mutation ) we will predict 9 diffrent class labels and determine that out of which actually cause Cancer.
